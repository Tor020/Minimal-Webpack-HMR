Build it from Scratch
---
Starter projects can be difficult for beginners to use because of all the moving pieces. To help you understand this starter project, there is a [7-step walkthrough](http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/) showing how to create it from scratch.





HMR
---

HMR is not supported in the master branch for simplicity. If you would like HMR support, you can [see the changes that add HMR support](https://github.com/ahfarmer/minimal-react-starter/compare/hmr) or you can directly clone the HMR branch:

```
git clone -b hmr git@github.com:ahfarmer/minimal-react-starter.git
```
